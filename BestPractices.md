## UAP Cell Phone Photo Best Practices

This is a list I'm collating of UAP media capture (i.e. photos, videos) best practices that can be implemented in UAP capture apps. Entries with question marks are random ideas that have to validated with UAP photography experts.

## Advice that should be given to people using cell phones to photograph/record UAP's

* Hold camera steady.
* Turn off flash
* Don't pan the camera unless the UFO is about to go out of frame?
* Don't use digital zoom.
* If not using a dedicated UAP capture app, go into your phone's settings and set the camera to the highest quality settings possible. Turn on HDR.
* Try to get terrain in the shot.
* Try to get an object with a commonly known size in the shot, to allow for estimating the size of the UAP.
* Don't crop photos, as that masks out terrain that could be useful in identification. Just send in the entire thing.
* Don't alter the exposure use photo editing tools.
* Make sure that GPS/Location services is turned on.
* Make sure your device allow for exif information in photos, if that's a permission on your device.
* Use the hightest optical zoom you can?
* Write a detailed account of what you saw as soon as you're photographed/recorded the event.
* Send a researcher the video/photo in full resolution. Don't export it to a smaller size.

## Actions developers of UAP apps can take:

### Photos

* Automatically for the user the highest resolution possible. iOS use Apple ProRAW and Apple ProRes.
* Don't let user use digital zoom. Intercept the pan jestsure.
* Detect optical zoom lenses and encourage user to use highest setting?
* Use augmentented reality to mark things commonly mistaken for UFO's. Satellites, Starlink, Venus, etc.

### Videos

* Automatically highest resolution and frame rate of video possible
* Advice user to hold camera steady, to capture movement. Use accelerometer to detect when the user is physically panning the camera and display a "pan warning" in the camera overlay.
* Keep recording until the UAP has left sight.
  
### Tutorial

* When the user opens the app for the first time, offer them either an interactive augmented reality tutorial or a link to an instructional video on Youtube.
* Ideally, the tutorial shouuld use the accelerometer to grade how shakily their holding camera, etc.
